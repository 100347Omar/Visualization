For my proggram to be runed the user should do the following when running:
1)if using jupyter notebook, then the user should press the run button which has
an arrow to the right and contains the word Run and if the code does not work there
is a restart button that runs the whole programme
2)if using visual studio call then the user will find the code and the graphs 
over there
